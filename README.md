#Â Alternative CMS

## Introduction

> This repo holds our efforts at providing an alternative open source CMS solution to support the core publishing system - PHEnet.  This becomes necessary because we are having some challenges with integrating RSS feeds on PHEnet with PHEtv. An alternative open source solution has been proposed and this project is to implement a drupal based CMS for publishing a news items that will feed through RSS to PHEtv.

## Dependencies

1. Vagrant - *host* requirement for provisioning guest operating system.
1. Vagrant plugins - vagrant-vbguest and vagrant-proxyconf on the host.
1. CentOS-7 as guest operating system.
1. Ansible for managing tasks on the guest and release to staging and production.
1. MySQL 5.5 for RDBMS on the guest.
1. Apache 2.4 as web server on the guest.
1. PHP 5 as application server runtime on the guest.
1. Drush 7 for managing Drupal on the guest.
1. Drupal 7 for host CMS solution on the guest.

## Installation instructions

> Follow the instructions below to install a self contained version of the RSS feed system.

**WIP**

## Test run

> Use instruction below to test and confirm the feed is available and reachable on the local system.
